This folder SHOULD contain all source code needed to build the project in STM32CubeIDE.

While CubeIDE is used, this is a bare-metal style project, it does NOT use Cube-IDE or any other external libraries.  The printf library was pulled from
https://github.com/mpaland/printf

Some of the startup code was pulled from a combination of bare-metal project resources and the CubeMX generated startup code.
